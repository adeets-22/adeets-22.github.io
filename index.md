# Aditi (uh-dee-tee)

![aditi](/adit.jpg)

heyo. i'm product manager, building in the world of magic internet money. for fun, i like to take care of my plants, techno cave, and write (sometimes).

i enjoy learning about any research that [nava ashraf](https://ashrafnava.wordpress.com/) or [nadia eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/oss/)put out, the south asian fintech market, OSS software, and privacy tech.

on the weekends, you can find me techno-caving in brooklyn, hating on the MTA, and reading my reddit subs at my [favorite cafes](https://www.notion.so/cafe-workspots-80b6b55555524fe88185d20806e30967).

[check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHs1lPCzK0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHs1lPCzK0) a demo I did at SXSW 2019 on abstracting the UX layer of crypto or [read](https://thejuggernaut.com/article?id=7vkLiVyhWm5guuwTPcbTCl) my take on India's *former* traditionalist ban on crypto if you're interested. [DM](https://twitter.com/adeets_22) me book recommendations (nothing Malcolm Gladwell) or ask me to write for you ðŸ—£
