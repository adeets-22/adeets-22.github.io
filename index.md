# Aditi (uh-dee-tee)

heyo. i'm product manager, with a special interest in magic internet money. for fun, i like to write about biz + tech trends and tend to my plants.

i enjoy learning about any research that [nava ashraf](https://ashrafnava.wordpress.com/) puts out, the **superior** (imo) south asian fintech market, OSS software, and skin care.

on the weekends, you can find me techno-caving in brooklyn, hating on the MTA, and reading my reddit subs at my favorite cafes.

[check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHs1lPCzK0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHs1lPCzK0) some of my happy users at SXSW 2019 or [read](https://thejuggernaut.com/article?id=7vkLiVyhWm5guuwTPcbTCl) my take on India's *former* traditionalist ban on crypto if you're interested. [DM](https://twitter.com/adeets_22) me book recommendations (nothing Malcolm Gladwell) or ask me to write for you.
