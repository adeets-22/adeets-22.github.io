# Aditi (uh-dee-tee)

![aditi](/adit.jpg)

heyo. i'm a product manager, building in the world of magic internet money. for fun, i like to take care of my plants, bring cryptotechnology to the creative world through [Xendia Labs](https://www.xendialabs.com/), and write. 

i enjoy any research that [nava ashraf](https://ashrafnava.wordpress.com/) or [nadia eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/oss/) puts out, learnign about OSS software, and privacy tech.

on the weekends, you can find me techno-caving in brooklyn, hating on the MTA, and reading my favorite reddit subs (r/tooafraidtoask, r/plants, r/creepyencounters, r/randonauts) at my [go-to cafes](https://www.notion.so/cafe-workspots-80b6b55555524fe88185d20806e30967).

[check out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHs1lPCzK0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHs1lPCzK0) a demo I did at SXSW 2019 on abstracting the UX layer of crypto or [DM](https://twitter.com/adeets_22) me book recommendations (nothing Malcolm Gladwell pls) ðŸ—£
